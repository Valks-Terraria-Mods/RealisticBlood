### Terraria Blood Mod

This is my first published Terraria mod.

Whenever the player is hit by the NPC or projectile, during the day a black color transition will come over the player along with a few blood particles. If the player is hit during the night than the transition color is red.

I will not be updating this mod to 1.4
